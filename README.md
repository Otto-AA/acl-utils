# ACL Utils [WIP]
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Otto-AA/acl-utils.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Otto-AA/acl-utils)

A js library for working with acl files. It allows you to parse the turtle representation, update permissions and agents, and finally convert it back to turtle. It *does not* cover fetching acl files.


# Status of the project
Basic functionality is already given, but it is still actively worked on. Documentation and examples will be added as soon as the code base is more stable. The tests for some files are already finished, for some there are partial tests and for some it is completely insufficient as of now.
